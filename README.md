# Is / Am / Are Practice

This is a simple interactive web app that helps learners practice using the correct form of the verb **to be**: *is, am, are*. Each time you click the play button, a random sentence appears with a blank. The learner must decide which form of the verb correctly completes the sentence.

## Features
- Randomly generates a new sentence on each click  
- Sentences include blanks for learners to fill with *is / am / are*  
- Clean, responsive design that works in any modern browser  
- No external dependencies, runs offline  

## How to Use

2. Click the **play button** (blue circle with white triangle)  
3. A new sentence with a blank will appear  
4. Fill in the blank with the correct verb (*is, am, are*)  

## Example
